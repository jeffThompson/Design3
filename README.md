DESIGN III
====
 
This course is the culmination of the Design sequence in the VA&T program, and as such it is mostly about long-form, self- directed design research. The goal is for you to continue to hone your voice and interests as a designer, to take on a large project requiring considerable creative investigation, and to make work that aligns with your goals as a professional.

Rather than be about technical tutorials and short-term projects, after the first few weeks (where we will loosely follow the Design 2 class with ramp-up projects), you will pitch a large- scale, multi-part design project to undertake for the rest of the semester.

Our theme for this semester‚Äôs project will be **The Future**. You‚Äôre welcome to approach it in any way you see fit, whether from the exploring the future of books and reading or our worries about machine learning and AI or promoting a new kind of basketball shoe or chronicling technological utopias or what the MTA might look like in 5 years... it‚Äôs wide open. The goal will be to visually articulate a view of the future.

I don‚Äôt want you to come up with a specific project yet, but it would be good to starting thinking about a direction you‚Äôd like to investigate and to work on researching this theme, since we‚Äôll jump right in at week four. We‚Äôll do group readings, interviews, and other wide-ranging research, and develop a project brief out of that work. We will have weekly (or so) individual chats and periodic group critiques of work in progress. The course will culminate in a cohesive exhibition and presentation of your project, including detailed documentation of your process.

##REQUIRED MATERIALS  
Towards the end of the semester we‚Äôll be working more digitally, but at the start you should bring these supplies every week. Purchase locally, or see [this list](http://a.co/7Bj19NL). Required and suggested readings will be provided as PDFs online ‚Äì there is no required textbook.

* **Laptop with Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop**  
Demos will be with Creative Cloud 2017. All students will have access to the full Creative Cloud suite free of charge through stevens.edu/vle, though using the Lab computers may be more reliable. If you use your laptop, please don‚Äôt forget your charger!
* **Sketchbook**  
At least 5x9‚Äù ‚Äì spiral-bound is best so you can tear out or scan drawings more easily. Please work one-sided only for the same reason.
* **Various drawing/writing implements**  
At least some pencils and pens of various kinds (I really like the Micron Pigma pens for drawing and layout ideation).
* **Digital camera**  
For gathering visual material (phone is ok).
* **Jar of India ink**  
Black, 1‚Äì2oz size (Higgins or Speedball brand is very good).
* **At least two medium-sized brushes of different sizes**  
Cheap ones are ok, synthetic bristles will probably be better for ink.
* **Bone folder**  
For folding paper; Teflon ones are fine, if you prefer.
* **Metal ruler**  
At least 12-inches long (15-inches is better), with or without cork backing.
* **Bookbinder‚Äôs awl**  
For making holes in paper; a regular carpenters awl may work, but one made for bookbinding will be better.
* **Larger knife with replacement blades**  
Olfa-brand knives are excellent, but a utility knife will work too. Optionally, you may also want an X-Acto knife with replacement blades.
* **Self-healing cutting mat**  
At least 9x12‚Äù (we have larger ones, but you should also have your own).
* **Bookbinding needle**  
(The eyes on regular sewing needles are far too small.)
* **Linen thread**  
Doesn‚Äôt stretch like normal sewing thread, making for tighter stitches.
* **Various papers and supplies as needed**  
For physical-focused projects and documentation of process.
* **Digital printing**  
At least two projects this semester, printed in the Fab Lab (better option) or locally.
* **Print-on-demand book**  
Cost will vary depending on size, but plan for $15‚Äì30 (we‚Äôll be using Blurb since they provide an easy-to-use InDesign plugin).
